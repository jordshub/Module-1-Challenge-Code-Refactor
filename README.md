# Module 1 Challenge - Code Refactor 

## Description

It is essential for a codebase to be functional, clean, concise and well commented when possible. This is not only good for the user experience but also the developer.
Through this challenge I learned the importance of attention to detail when coding, how certain CSS elements behave when altered and also the importance of accesibility.
